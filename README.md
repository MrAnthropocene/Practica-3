# **Practica 3 Web Design Applications**


## **Purpose: Build a responsive image gallery using Grid and media queries.**

### **1. Create a gallery layout that displays images in a grid.**
I just use the examples that we saw in the classroom, that helps me to understand better how the grid displays works on css.

### **3. Use media queries to Show a single column on small screens:**  
  Making use of the media option, i succesfully make the responsive screen for different kind of devices. 
  Show multiple columns on larger screens: using the grid-template-columns: repeat(,); I've selected how many columns are needed for the screen display


### **4. Add hover effects to highlight images when the user hovers over them.**
  With the hover option added, I've made possible highlight the image selected on the screen.
